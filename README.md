# What?
CSSC Constitution

# Why?
It took me ages to find older versions of the clubs constitution for when I wanted to rewrite it in LaTeX in late 2017

I went looking for older versions because officially the constitution we had between some time in 2015 to when I rewrote it and got it passed at our AGM we were using one which wasn't actually passed or valid.
The changes in the end were minor, but it's worth noting that there were some.

And now that it's being tracked by git we can keep track of what happens and when.

# Who?

Anton Savill - 2017 President.
Jordan Campbell - 2022 Vice-President
# When
The Current constitution was written in 2017. (Which tracking starts from, all previous constitution are to be considered 0.x.x.x)

  X.0.0.0 Changes shall be used for major or significant alterations. i.e. complete rewrites or significant structure changes.  
  0.X.0.0 Changes shall be reserved for removal, addition or replacement of entire sections within the constitution.  
  0.0.X.0 Changes shall be for small changes within one or multiple sections of the constitution. Rearrangement of Sections shall be considered one of these increments too.  
  0.0.0.X Changes are for minor changes, such as spelling & grammatical corrections, or for changes not related to the constitution itself. Such as this readme.

  1.0.3.3 Additional Powers given to the Returning Officer to ensure a fair election in the clubs best interest is held.  
  1.0.4.0 Added a section for the history of the constitution to be recorded, I'm expecting it to reference these change numbers.  
  1.0.4.1 Formalised "Policies" as an alternative to regulations, this is simply so the committee can have choice of wording.

  1.0.6.0 Addition of the Marketing Officer Position to the executive committee section
# Contributing
There should probably be a process of making pull requests for proposals to change the clubs constitution.
I'm going to leave that up to a future committee to determine and decide on.

In the interim, just hassle committee with your changes and they'll pass and push up changes to the master branch and whatnot.
