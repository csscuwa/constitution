# What?

CSSC Constitution

# Why?

It took me ages to find older versions of the clubs constitution for when I wanted to rewrite it in LaTeX in late 2017

I went looking for older versions because officially the constitution we had between some time in 2015 to when I rewrote it and got it passed at our AGM we were using one which wasn't actually passed or valid.
The changes in the end were minor, but it's worth noting that there were some.

And now that it's being tracked by git we can keep track of what happens and when.

# Who?

Anton Savill - 2017 President.
Jordan Campbell - 2022 Vice-President.

# When

The Current constitution was written in 2017. (Which tracking starts from, all previous constitution are to be considered 0.x.x.x)

# Contributing

There should probably be a process of making pull requests for proposals to change the clubs constitution.
I'm going to leave that up to a future committee to determine and decide on.

In the interim, just hassle committee with your changes and they'll pass and push up changes to the master branch and whatnot.
